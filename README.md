This project is a culmination of all that was taught in my first semester of 4th year and further extrapolation from it. My courses consist of advanced linear algebra, Partial differential equations (again a bit of linalg) and quantum mechanics (again linalg). I was solving schrodinger eqns in my QM class and I learnt about discretizing PDE is my PDE class. I linked the connection between my PDE and QM class and observed that they were solving sort of the exact same kinds of problems, The schrodinger eqn is an example of a strum-liouville PDE and I can discretize it to solve for its eigenfunctions. Since I wanted to learn OpenGL and C++, I decided to start this project as an attempt visualize the spherical harmonics and wavefunctions similar to the [qmsolve](https://github.com/quantum-visualizations/qmsolve) git repo but in C++ and in lower complexity. 

There will be a devblog post series about this project so that others can see my work and how I came up with these solutions. One of my constraints is that I would limit my use of AI to only minor bug fixes and syntax correction, everything else would be my hand written code and blog posts.
